## Ada Lovelace

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace

##### FRONT:

Born: Ada Byron, 10 December 1815 in London, England

Died: 27 November 1852

was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage")'s proposed mechanical general-purpose [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer"), the [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine "Analytical Engine"). She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.

##### BACK:

When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.

Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated [an article](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Scientific_Memoirs/3/Sketch_of_the_Analytical_Engine_invented_by_Charles_Babbage,_Esq. "wikisource:Scientific Memoirs/3/Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, Esq.") by the military engineer [Luigi Menabrea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Federico_Menabrea "Luigi Federico Menabrea") (later [Prime Minister of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Italy "Prime Minister of Italy")) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with [an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called &#34;Notes&#34;](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Scientific_Memoirs/3/Sketch_of_the_Analytical_Engine_invented_by_Charles_Babbage,_Esq./Notes_by_the_Translator "wikisource:Scientific Memoirs/3/Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, Esq./Notes by the Translator").

Lovelace's notes are important in the early [history of computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computers "History of computers"), especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.

She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.

##### FRONT:

Born: March 12, 1939, in Washington, D.C., USA

Died: July 19, 2003

best known by her [pseudonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym "Pseudonym")  **St. Jude** , was a self-taught programmer, civil rights advocate, [writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer "Writer"), [editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor "Editor"), advocate for women in computing, [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)) "Hacker (programmer subculture)") and author in the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area "San Francisco Bay Area").

Milhon coined the term [cypherpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk "Cypherpunk") and was a founding member of the [cypherpunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk "Cypherpunk"). On July 19, 2003, Milhon died of cancer.

##### BACK:

Milhon taught herself programming in 1967 and landed her first job at the [Horn and Hardart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_and_Hardart "Horn and Hardart") vending machine company of New York before she moved away to California to join the counterculture movement. She worked at the Berkeley Computer Company (an outgrowth of [Project Genie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Genie "Project Genie")), and she helped implement the communications controller of the BCC timesharing system. In 1971 she partnered with other local activists and technologists at [Project One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_One_(San_Francisco)) "Project One (San Francisco)"), where she was particularly drawn to the [Resource One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_One "Resource One") project, with the goal of creating the Bay Area's first public computerized bulletin board system.

In 1973, a subset of the Resource One group, including Milhon, broke away to create Community Memory in Berkeley. Later, she also worked on [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution "Berkeley Software Distribution"), a Unix-based operating system developed by the Computer Systems Research Group at UC Berkeley.

She was a member of [Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Professionals_for_Social_Responsibility "Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility"), and the author of several books. She was a senior editor at the magazine *[Mondo 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondo_2000 "Mondo 2000")* and frequent contributor to [Boing Boing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boing_Boing "Boing Boing").

##### FRONT:

Born: Rózsa Politzer, 17 February 1905 in [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest "Budapest"), Hungary

Died: 16 February 1977

was a [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary "Hungary") [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician") and [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logician "Logician"). She is best known as the "founding mother of [recursion theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_theory "Recursion theory")". Beginning in the mid-1950s, Péter applied recursive function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was *Rekursive Funktionen in der Komputer-Theorie* (Recursive Functions in Computer Theory). Originally published in Hungarian, it was the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union because its subject matter was considered indispensable to the [theory of computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation "Theory of computation"). It was translated into English in 1981.

##### BACK:

Péter presented the results of her paper on recursive theory, "*Rekursive Funktionen*", to the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") in Zürich, Switzerland in 1932. In the summer of 1933, she worked with [Paul Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernays "Paul Bernays") in Göttingen, Germany, for the long chapter on [recursive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_function_(computability)) "Recursive function (computability)") in the book *Grundlagen der Mathematik* that appeared in 1934 under the names of [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert "David Hilbert") and Bernays. Her main results are summarised in the book and also appeared in several articles in the leading journal of mathematics, the *[Mathematische Annalen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematische_Annalen "Mathematische Annalen")*, the first in 1934. Publication was under the name Politzer-Péter as she had changed her Jewish surname Politzer into Péter that same year. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled "*Über rekursive Funktionen der zweiten Stufe*" to the [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Congress_of_Mathematicians "International Congress of Mathematicians") in Oslo. These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research.

During World War II, she wrote her book  *[Playing with Infinity: Mathematical Explorations and Excursions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_with_Infinity "Playing with Infinity")* , a work for lay readers on the topics of number theory and logic. Originally published in Hungarian, it has been translated into English and at least a dozen other languages.

In 1951, she published her key work  *Rekursive Funktionen*, the first book on modern logic by a female author, later translated into English as  *Recursive Functions* . She continued to publish important papers on recursive theory throughout her life. In 1959, she presented a major paper "*Über die Verallgemeinerung der Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen für abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als Definitionsbereiche*" to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961 and 1962).

##### FRONT:

Born: Adele Katz, December 21, 1920 in New York City, USA

Died: November 1964

was an American mathematician and computer programmer. She wrote the manual for the first electronic digital computer, [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC "ENIAC"). Through her work programming the computer, she was also an instrumental player in converting the ENIAC from a computer that needed to be reprogrammed each time it was used to one that was able to perform a set of fifty [stored instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer "Stored-program computer").

##### BACK:

As an instructor of mathematics for the women "[computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer "Human computer")" at the Moore School, Goldstine also trained some of the six women who were the original programmers of ENIAC to manually calculate ballistic trajectories (complex differential calculations). The job of computer was critical to the war effort, and women were regarded as capable of doing the work more rapidly and accurately than men. By 1943, and for the balance of World War II, essentially all computers were women as were many of their direct supervisors.

Goldstine wrote the Operators Manual for the ENIAC. Reconfiguring the machine to solve a different problem involved physically plugging and unplugging wires on the machine; it was called "setting-up," as the modern terminology of "program" had not yet come into use.

In 1946 Goldstine sat in on programming sessions with Bartik and Dick Clippinger and was hired to help implement Clippinger's [stored program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_program "Stored program") modification to the ENIAC. [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") was a consultant on the selection of the [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set "Instruction set") implemented. This solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run; instead the program was entered on the three function tables, which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectory's drag function.

After the war, Goldstine continued her programming work with von Neumann at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory "Los Alamos National Laboratory"), where she devised problems for ENIAC to process.
