December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992

American [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist"), [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician"), and [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") [rear admiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral_(United_States)) "Rear admiral (United States)").

One of the first programmers of the [Harvard Mark I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I "Harvard Mark I") computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the [FLOW-MATIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC "FLOW-MATIC") programming language she created using this theory was later extended by others to create [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL "COBOL"), an early [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language") still in use today.

She believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language. Her compiler converted English terms into [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code") understood by computers.

Hopper’s first compiler, A-O, was unveiled in 1949 and used symbolic mathematical code to represent binary code combinations. She followed up with B-O, or “Flow-Matic,” which is considered the first English language data-processing compiler. It was used to program UNIVAC I and II machines by the end of 1956.

When discussions arose as to how to create a standardized, universal computer language, Hopper was deeply involved in the development of COBOL.  Her Flow-Matic compiler was used to help form a basis for the language, and she designed standard manuals and tools for it, as well as translator programs that converted non-standard COBOL languages into the standard version. The first specifications for COBOL were made available in 1959.

## Hedy Lamarr

### Military communucations System

https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/hedy-lamarr

On June 10, 1941, Lamarr and composer George Antheil received Patent No. 2,292,387 for their invention of a classified communication system that was especially useful for submarines. The system was a stroke of genius. It was based on radio frequencies, changed at irregular periods, that were synchronized between the transmitter and receiver.

While a message was being sent, both the transmitter and the receiver would simultaneously change radio frequencies according to a special code. At each end of the transmission, identical slotted paper rolls, similar to those used on player pianos, dictated the code according to their pattern of slots. Just as a player piano holds and changes notes at different intervals to make a melody, their invention held and changed radio frequencies to make an unbreakable code. Signals could be transmitted without being detected, deciphered, or jammed.

Although the U.S. Navy originally rejected Lamarr's idea, they did use her concept of "frequency-hopping" during missions in later years.

Lamarr received several awards for her invention, including the 1997 Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for her contributions to the field of spread-spectrum technology. She died in Florida in the year 2000.
